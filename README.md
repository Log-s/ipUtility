# ipUtility

This tool is used to pool out information for given IPs and Masks.

I coded this for an exam to be able to get information without having to apply the network mask by hand for example.

There is no data verification, and the the code couldn't be more uggly. But I probably won't use it any time soon again, and it worked out fine for the 1h long exam.
